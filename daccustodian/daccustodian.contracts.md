The intent of this action is to signal the end of one election period and commence the next. It performs several actions after the following conditions are met:
 * The action is not called before the period should have ended
 * Enough voter value has participated to trigger the initial running of the DAC
 * After the Dac has started enough voter value has continued engagement with the dac voting process. 
1. Calculate the mean `requestedpay` of all the currently elected custodians.
2. Distribute the median pay amount to all the currently elected custodians. This is achieved by adding a record to the `pendingpay` table with the custodian and the amount payable in preparation for an authorised action to `claimpay`.
3. Captures the highest voted candidates to set them as the custodians for the next period based on the accumulated vote weight.
4. Set the permissions for the elected custodians so they have sufficient permission to run the dac according to the constitution and technical permissions design.
5. Set the time for the beginning of the next period to mark the reset anniversary for the dac.
